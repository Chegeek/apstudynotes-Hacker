# The Buildup

When I was a high school senior applying to colleges, I found the website www.apstudynotes.org/essays/ extremely helpful.
I took immense inspiration from reading the essays, and it significantly helped me shape my essays when application season started.

However, most of the essays are barred behind a pay wall. At the time, I was able to bypass this by going into inspect element
and just deleting the paywall and changing the 'blur' effect. They've since changed the site and it's become a little more difficult
to actually get through to the essays.

I've been learning Python and I finally reached the web scraping chapter. After a few pages in, I decided to stop where I
was at and start writing a program to dowload all 141 essays on the apstudynotes site. Let the hacking begin!

<p>Northwestern Statement: What are the unique qualities of Northwestern - and of the specific undergraduate school to which you are applying - that make you want to attend the University? In what ways do you hope to take advantage of the qualities you have identified? (300 words)</p><p>Sweat drips onto my violin as we are filing into the auditorium.</p><p>I just arrived from a basketball game, I’m not nervous. However, that changes when I realize that I still have my basketball shoes on. And that I still have a plethora of edits to make in the newspaper room. And that I have three tests the next day.</p><p>Fun.</p><p>---</p><p>Although it was stressful, I enjoyed every minute of juggling such diverse extracurriculars. I appreciated the many opportunities that my high school gave me, and took advantage of as many as I could handle. Thanks to these opportunities, I’ve fallen in love with various topics in different disciplines; all of which can be nurtured at Northwestern.</p><p>I’d be thrilled to pursue membership in the University Singers and the Philharmonia. It would be a great opportunity to learn from nationally recognized Emily Ellsworth with the Singers. I would also love to continue working with orchestral music in the Philharmonia.</p><p>The excellent humanities classes at the Weinberg School of Arts and Sciences also interest me. I’d love to pursue further education in subjects I was introduced to in high school, such as physics, psychology, and economics.</p><p>Finally, I believe that I am a perfect fit for the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science due to its unique philosophy. The idea of “Whole-Brain Engineering” meshes perfectly with my interest in a wide array of subjects and disciplines. I have always believed in equal emphasis on logic and creativity in problem-solving situations, and an education at McCormick (and Northwestern in general) will bolster my well-roundedness.</p><p>My Northwestern experience isn’t only about reaching an engineering career, but growing as a person. Such balanced growth will allow me to succeed through analyzation and innovation, preparing me to have an impact on the world.</p><p><strong>Enlist the expert help of one of our Ivy-League editors.</strong> Get individual coaching to make your essay stand out among the crowd. <a href="/essay-review/">Learn more.</a></p><p>Keep reading more <a href="/northwestern/">Northwestern admissions essays</a> — you can't be too prepared!</p><p><a class="btn large prev" href="/northwestern/northwestern-supplement/" title="Prev: Northwestern Supplement - Engineering &amp; Music">Previous Essay</a><a class="btn large next" href="/northwestern/northwestern-supplement/" title="Next: Northwestern Supplement - Engineering &amp; Music">Next Essay</a></p><p><em>Tip: Use the ← → keys to navigate!</em></p><p class="randomquote"><q>Data is not information, information is not knowledge, knowledge is not understanding, understanding is not wisdom.</q> <span class="quote-attribution">Clifford Stoll</span></p><p>That's easy — it's the best way to study for AP classes and AP exams!

<p>Virtually all of Stanford’s undergraduates live on campus. Write a note to your future roommate that reveals something about you or that will help your roommate—and us—know you better.</p><p>Hey roommate!</p><p>Looks like we both made it. Great! Just wanted to let you know a bit about my best traits, and hopefully in the end we won’t end up as room-hates.</p><p>I hail from the burbs of Chicago, and, yes, it snows all the way to your nose, and blackens your toes, but in the Windy City it really does not blow. Truly, in this town I’ve found out who I am: innovative and energetic like the mighty Hoover dam. And with my brute ambition I make no contractions out of can; the “t” stays in my only knot that reminds me who I am.</p><p>Now, I guess I’ll have you know, that I’m a Yankees fan. Born in New York, I could say it’s not my plan, but really that it evolved from a friendship that I had when I moved to California ‘cause a job was offered to my dad. Living in the Golden State for my years from 2-8 created a base for me to create the open-minded me. Free of care, a child there is open to just breathe fresh air and inhale ideas free of fares. It’s how kids’ lives should be.</p><p>But times did change, as they do, because of towers and planes we decided we should move. To be closer to family is a decision made without blinkin’, so I had to pack up shirts and shoes and head Midwest towards the Land of Lincoln. Tears in eyes, I waved good-bye to my friends of the C-A-L-I. It was bright and oh-so-fly, but Illinois would get me thinkin’.</p><p>From the start I could tell the schools were very diff’rent: content based and standards soaring with no lax or relent. But I thrived and pushed myself past each class’s torment, and in the end my informed thoughts furthered in their ferment. Now each day I question, not out of spite or mad aggression, but because improvement has become this glad man’s mad obsession. So be prepared to stay up late, involved in friendly, long debates or conversations about fate or even simply what we ate. I promise you, my new roommate, I will not ever demonstrate any shape or form of hate, ‘cause that is not life’s lesson.</p><p>I’ll be your Kobe, you’ll be my Shaq—well… I mean, before that all went whack. Sorry, man, that was on the wrong track, but cut me some slack, ‘cause now we’ve got each other’s backs.</p><p>Let’s keep it cool, be friends and scholars, to you at school I’ll pop my collar and maybe even lend a dollar, all you’ve got to do is… holler.</p><p><strong>Enlist the expert help of one of our Ivy-League editors.</strong> Get individual coaching to make your essay stand out among the crowd. <a href="/essay-review/">Learn more.</a></p><p>Keep reading more <a href="/stanford/">Stanford admissions essays</a> — you can't be too prepared!</p><p><a class="btn large prev" href="/stanford/what-matters-to-you-and-why-my-father/" title='Prev: What matters to you, and why? - "My Father"'>Previous Essay</a><a class="btn large next" href="/stanford/what-matters-to-you-and-why/" title="Next: What matters to you, and why?">Next Essay</a></p><p><em>Tip: Use the ← → keys to navigate!</em></p><p class="randomquote"><q>Education is the key to unlock the golden door of freedom.</q> <span class="quote-attribution">George Washington Carver</span></p><p>That's easy — it's the best way to study for AP classes and AP exams!

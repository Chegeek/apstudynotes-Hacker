<p>How did you first learn about Rice University and what motivated you to apply? (250 word limit)</p><p> </p><p>"We are going to visit Rice today" My mom leaned back in her front row seat and said to me.</p><p><em>Wait, is that a restaurant specializing in all kinds of rice dishes? Like fried rice, rice soup, and rice balls?</em> My brain went into a frenzy.</p><p>All other questions flooding my thoughts dissipated, however, when my eyes lay on Rice's beautiful Byzantine styled buildings with its magnificent archways and its soft sand-pink brick walls. While just outside its surroundings the thriving city life of Houston continues, Rice kept its sacred ground intimate with its relatively small campus and peaceful with its large spreads of greenery and shades. <em>It's perfect!</em>, said my right brain, falling in love at first-sight with the campus. My left brain, however, chastised the emotional side of me with <em>Don't read a book by its cover. You can't just choose your true love like that!</em></p><p>Exasperated by my left brain, I attended an information seminar. Phrases like "Passport to Houston", "Best Quality of Student Life", "Oshman Engineering Design Kitchen", and "more than 40 interdisciplinary centers" flashes by my eyes. Almost unlimited access to Houston's transportation and hangout spots? A research facility where I can group with students of all fields and work on solving real-world problems? Friendly research faculty who might allow me to continue my interdisciplinary research in psychology and computer science? My left brain finally gave in. <em>Alright, alright. Let's go make Rice into not just a staple for food, but also education, then.</em></p><p><strong>Enlist the expert help of one of our Ivy-League editors.</strong> Get individual coaching to make your essay stand out among the crowd. <a href="/essay-review/">Learn more.</a></p><p>Keep reading more <a href="/rice/">Rice admissions essays</a> — you can't be too prepared!</p><p><a class="btn large prev" href="/rice/why-engineering-cs-2/" title="Prev: Why Engineering/CS">Previous Essay</a><a class="btn large next" href="/rice/why-engineering-cs-2/" title="Next: Why Engineering/CS">Next Essay</a></p><p><em>Tip: Use the ← → keys to navigate!</em></p><p class="randomquote"><q>Learning is not attained by chance, it must be sought for with ardor and diligence.</q> <span class="quote-attribution">Abigail Adams</span></p><p>That's easy — it's the best way to study for AP classes and AP exams!

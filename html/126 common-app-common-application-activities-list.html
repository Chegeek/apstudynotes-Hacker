The first, and most important, reason I worked with the student was to help him understand and work through his online credit recovery course in first semester Precalculus. As I worked with him in the online course, I took the methods I gained from Kumon and my enthusiastic love for the subject to provide him a greater understanding for his course, and he earned the credit he needed towards graduation. I also assisted him in trigonometry for second semester precalculus, which he was enrolled in at the time, as well as assisted him in mathematics practice for the ELM. The ELM is the CSU placement test for mathematics which includes algebra and geometry questions. I furthered his understanding of the ELM, and he later passed the test as he entered SDSU.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Kumon Learning Center  </strong>Mar 2014 - Nov 2014</p><p><span>Position: Grader/Teaching Assistant</span></p><p>Average hours per week: 8</p><p>As a Kumon assistant, I provided students with help in their reading and mathematics Kumon work. I initially learned how to grade papers of the programs and served as a grader for the facility's classwork from students, but I later became a teaching assistant. Most of the help I provided as an assistant was for students in high school math topics such as trigonometry, algebra, and calculus. As teaching assistant, I became engaged in working with the students one-on-one to ensure they understood their independent studies, and also worked in creating their curriculum and topic plans. This involved a careful scheduling of their coursework and analysis of their curriculum progress. Through the work program, I discovered methods of teaching that created my stronger career interest in education and research such as teaching through graphical analysis or diagrams. This job occurred off school hours during summer and the school year.</p><p><strong>Enlist the expert help of one of our Ivy-League editors.</strong> Get individual coaching to make your essay stand out among the crowd. <a href="/essay-review/">Learn more.</a></p><p>Keep reading more <a href="/common-app/">Common App admissions essays</a> — you can't be too prepared!</p><p><a class="btn large prev" href="/common-app/discuss-an-accomplishment-i-am-my-own/" title='Prev: Discuss an accomplishment - "I am my own temple"'>Previous Essay</a><a class="btn large next" href="/common-app/extracurricular-activity-or-work/" title='Next: Extracurricular activity or work experience – "I am Chopin"'>Next Essay</a></p><p><em>Tip: Use the ← → keys to navigate!</em></p><p class="randomquote"><q>The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn.</q> <span class="quote-attribution">Alvin Toffler</span></p><p>That's easy — it's the best way to study for AP classes and AP exams!

<p>Please briefly elaborate on one of your extracurricular activities or work experiences in the space below or on an attached sheet (150 words or fewer).</p><p>After a long school day, I frequently come home and rush straight to my piano, where I close my eyes and play out my emotions. But though I have been playing traditional piano for ten years, you will be hard-pressed to find me churning out a vigorous Chopin etude for fun; instead, my greatest joy comes from improvising covers of my favorite popular songs. When I am feeling down, playing Akon cheers me up. In my mischievous moods, I channel Billy Talent into the keys. Catch me in my happiest hour, and I am found swaying on a piano bench, eyes closed, arms loose, blasting Matt and Kim's Daylight through the house. I seem to live in a world overly concerned with certainties, and I am just glad I have music in my life to unwind, to express myself through songs I love. No sheet music, no pressure, no limitations. </p><p><strong>Enlist the expert help of one of our Ivy-League editors.</strong> Get individual coaching to make your essay stand out among the crowd. <a href="/essay-review/">Learn more.</a></p><p>Keep reading more <a href="/common-app/">Common App admissions essays</a> — you can't be too prepared!</p><p><a class="btn large prev" href="/common-app/the-colour-of-passion/" title="Prev: The Colour of Passion">Previous Essay</a><a class="btn large next" href="/common-app/the-pub/" title='Next: "The Pub"'>Next Essay</a></p><p><em>Tip: Use the ← → keys to navigate!</em></p><p>This essay comes from AdmitSphere who kindly allowed it to be republished here.</p><p class="randomquote"><q>The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn.</q> <span class="quote-attribution">Alvin Toffler</span></p><p>That's easy — it's the best way to study for AP classes and AP exams!

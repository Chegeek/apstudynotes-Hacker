I'm assuming you don't know about South-Indian middle names so here's what you should know: "Reddy" is the name of a caste in India thought to have consisted of warriors who later became lords and aristocracy. This caste became part of the Reddy Dynasty, established by Prolaya Vema Reddi. This South-Indian kingdom ruled coastal and central Andhra for 100+ years from approximately 1325-1448 CE. I could go on and give you a full history lesson, but the point isn't that my middle name originates from a line of warriors and kings. The point is, though I admire my ancestry, I can't personally connect to my middle name: I'm not a warrior or a king. So I reinvented myself. On the first day of 10th-Grade Pre-Calculus I asked to be called by my middle name. My teacher asked and I'll never forget his look of sheer confusion when I told him my middle name. It's strange knowing most people have no idea what my middle name really means. But that was my intention. For me, "Reddy" no longer denotes a caste. It represents someone who serves on a first-aid squad, knows how to ride a motorcycle, has a quirky randomness about him, texts as if writing a research paper (without slang), and wears flips-flops in the morning but moccasins in the evening. Honestly, you can use my first or middle name, but whatever you do, just know that I'll be "Reddy."</p><p><strong>Enlist the expert help of one of our Ivy-League editors.</strong> Get individual coaching to make your essay stand out among the crowd. <a href="/essay-review/">Learn more.</a></p><p>Keep reading more <a href="/stanford/">Stanford admissions essays</a> — you can't be too prepared!</p><p><a class="btn large prev" href="/stanford/stanford-short-essays-fall-2007/" title="Prev: Stanford Short Essays (Fall 2007)">Previous Essay</a><a class="btn large next" href="/stanford/the-cure-for-homesickness/" title="Next: The cure for homesickness">Next Essay</a></p><p><em>Tip: Use the ← → keys to navigate!</em></p><p class="randomquote"><q>Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire.</q> <span class="quote-attribution">William Butler Yeats</span></p><p>That's easy — it's the best way to study for AP classes and AP exams!

The drumbeat rattling my teeth is nearly overpowered by my deafening crash onto rock bottom. The 2011 school year cut me to pieces. I was a sophomore – a year notorious for being easier than the rest at my school – attending the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts after school. I got home at 7 every evening, rarely getting to bed before midnight. I struggled to keep my head above water, craving the happiness summer would surely bring.</p><p>    October 26th, 2012: I am alone. I am ecstatic. I am at a Skrillex concert. The electronica master charges my body with his fancy musical gadgets; I release the energy by losing myself in the pulsing crowd. The 2012 school year took one look at me and couldn’t help but laugh. I spent the entire summer at a summer camp in the mountains of North Carolina, and I came home feeling invincible. I found myself staring at my glass of water, just because. Water, ya know? Water!<br/>    On my rollercoaster ride through high school, I realized that I am in control of my state of mind. As I embark on my next big journey, I’m glad to know that I have the ability to take control of my life when it seems terrible and stay grounded when it seems fantastic. I’ve always hated rollercoasters, but this is one ride I won’t regret.</p><p><strong>Enlist the expert help of one of our Ivy-League editors.</strong> Get individual coaching to make your essay stand out among the crowd. <a href="/essay-review/">Learn more.</a></p><p>Keep reading more <a href="/stanford/">Stanford admissions essays</a> — you can't be too prepared!</p><p><a class="btn large prev" href="/stanford/what-matters-to-you-and-why/" title="Prev: What matters to you, and why?">Previous Essay</a><a class="btn large next" href="/stanford/roommate-essay-good-morning/" title='Next: Roommate Essay - "Good Morning"'>Next Essay</a></p><p><em>Tip: Use the ← → keys to navigate!</em></p><p class="randomquote"><q>The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn.</q> <span class="quote-attribution">Alvin Toffler</span></p><p>That's easy — it's the best way to study for AP classes and AP exams!

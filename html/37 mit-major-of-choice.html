<p>Although you may not yet know what you want to major in, which department or program at MIT appeals to you and why?</p><p>I am very attracted to the opportunity to explore the offerings at MIT’s <span>Mathematics and Physics Departments. Mathematics and physics have been my </span><span>academic passions ever since I entered high school. Therefore, I am confident </span><span>that my academic interests will involve those fields. I am fascinated by how </span><span>mathematics and physics interact. Something that appeals to me is that, in </span><span>today’s world, these fields are as “practical” as engineering or business. I </span><span>am especially interested in understanding the language of physics and </span><span>mathematics as they are reflected in the workings of the universe and their </span><span>applications to the modern world.</span></p><p> </p><p><strong>Enlist the expert help of one of our Ivy-League editors.</strong> Get individual coaching to make your essay stand out among the crowd. <a href="/essay-review/">Learn more.</a></p><p>Keep reading more <a href="/mit/">MIT admissions essays</a> — you can't be too prepared!</p><p><a class="btn large prev" href="/mit/essays/" title="Prev: MIT Short Essays">Previous Essay</a><a class="btn large next" href="/mit/what-you-do-for-fun/" title="Next: What You Do For Fun">Next Essay</a></p><p><em>Tip: Use the ← → keys to navigate!</em></p><p class="randomquote"><q>It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.</q> <span class="quote-attribution">Aristotle</span></p><p>That's easy — it's the best way to study for AP classes and AP exams!

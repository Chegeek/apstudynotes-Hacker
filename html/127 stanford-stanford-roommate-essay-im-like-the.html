<p>Virtually all of Stanford's undergraduates live on campus. Write a note to your future roommate that reveals something about you or that will help your roommate -- and us -- know you better. (250 word limit.)</p><p>Greetings future roommate!</p><p>I look forward to sharing a room and a brand new experience altogether as college freshmen! If there is one thing that you should know about me, it is that although my personality is splotched with hundreds of shades, akin to a Jackson Pollock painting, you can most certainly count on my character, which boils down to a couple traits: calm and content. I would like to compare my personality to the ocean – it has its ebb and flow, its crests and trenches, but one can always expect it to return to its natural gentle state.</p><p>The ocean has remained relevant to life for millions of years. Just like the ocean spans across eras, my interests capture that same duality, being split between vintage and modern. So don’t be intimidated to ask me to go see the new Star Wars movie when I’m still toting around my Nintendo 64 and PlayStation 2. The ocean also has its stagnant parts, like the Dead Sea. Parts of my character can be immobile, such as my surprisingly unvaried palate. Don’t bat an eye when I enjoy pizza for an entire lunar cycle! The ocean also nurtures indiscriminately. I can relate because of my sense of duty to help others, so don’t ever be afraid to ask for advice or reassurance. I’m always happy to assist!</p><p>Overall, just how the ocean always flows in a gentle manner, you can always count on me to remain loyal and retain a level head and attitude.</p><p><strong>Enlist the expert help of one of our Ivy-League editors.</strong> Get individual coaching to make your essay stand out among the crowd. <a href="/essay-review/">Learn more.</a></p><p>Keep reading more <a href="/stanford/">Stanford admissions essays</a> — you can't be too prepared!</p><p><a class="btn large prev" href="/stanford/intellectual-vitality-essay-technology/" title='Prev: Intellectual Vitality Essay - "Technology consulting"'>Previous Essay</a><a class="btn large next" href="/stanford/what-do-you-care-about-and-why/" title="Next: What do you care about and why?">Next Essay</a></p><p><em>Tip: Use the ← → keys to navigate!</em></p><p class="randomquote"><q>Always do your best.

Describe the world you come from — for example, your family, community or school — and tell us how your world has shaped your dreams and aspirations.


 


      “Teachers don’t earn enough money.” My father’s words resonated through my head. “How are you going to attain a lavish lifestyle in the future?” My father’s perspective was echoed by my cousin, who recently obtained his doctorate in molecular biology from the University of London. When there were not enough funds for him to continue his research on the immunization against malaria, he became a security analyst for JP Morgan. He attempted to dissuade me from pursuing a career in education as he claimed that in the end, money still matters the most.


         Despite the discouragements towards my interest to become an educator, my passion has not dwindled. Instead, it has intensified. My first inspiration was that of my eighth grade algebra teacher, Mr. Buhler, who was the epitome of a dedicated, knowledgeable teacher. His enthusiasm for math pervaded the entire class as he implemented engaging lessons that allowed us to apply what we learned to realistic situations. This included calculating the rate of a speeding car as a police clocks a radar gun. Not only did he teach us academically, but also, on the last day of school, he inspired us to believe that we can achieve anything if we put our full efforts into our aspirations. It was then that I knew that I would become a teacher in the future. I would not only educate students proficiently as did Mr. Buhler, but I would also be a positive change agent in students’ lives: to motivate the younger generations into becoming the best person that they can be.


         My passion was further ignited when I began teaching in a classroom setting. I realized that it was not only enjoyable, but also ideally suited to me. I have an innate ability to expand the students’ knowledge while inspiring the students to reach their full potential. When I first became an Academic Coach for an algebra class, I was skeptical and apprehensive as the students were unwilling to receive help from a fellow student. I constantly offered my help to the students, but they stoically declined even though it was evident that they did not know how to solve the problems. They were consistently indifferent to the teacher’s lessons yet they complained about their plunging test grades. I decided to take an alternative approach as I brought over a white board, wrote down the math problem, and asked them to speculate the next step. Soon after, all of the students willingly accepted my help and even expressed gratitude for my efforts.


         My hands-on experience of teaching in a classroom setting, both at elementary and high school level, has solidified my resolution of becoming an educator who makes a significant difference in the students’ lives. I asserted my desire of educating students by recounting my teaching experiences to my father. He began to realize how I made a valuable impact in the students’ lives. This unwavering, intense passion has even turned my father, a disbeliever, into an advocate and a supporter.
